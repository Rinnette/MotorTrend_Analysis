## Exploratory data analysis
Check the structure of the dataset

```{r}
        str(m)
```

The variables we are interested in are *mpg* and *am*.  The class of *am* was converted to factor for the purposes of this exercises.
```{r}
        m$am = factor(m$am)

```

Checked the summary of *mpg*.  Also separated the data in two groups by transmission type and checked the summary for each group.

```{r summary}
        summary(m$mpg)
        table (m$am)
        ma <- filter(m, am == 0)
        mm <- filter(m, am == 1)
        summary(ma$mpg)
        summary(mm$mpg)

```
The mean MPG for cars with a manual transmission is higher than that in manual cars.

A boxplot of the data is provided.

```{r boxplotAM}
        ## include main heading and resize
        m <- mutate(m, Transmission = factor(m$am))
        levels(m$Transmission) = c("Automatic", "Manual")
        ggplot(m, aes(x=Transmission, y=mpg, fill = Transmission)) + geom_boxplot()

```
Clearly indicates that manual cars have a higher MPG than automatic cars.



## Model selection and strategy
Outcome is continuous and predictor is a factor variable. 

Two methods used:

* Linear regression
* ANOVA - does MPG depend on transmission type
* OLS regression
* probit model


## Linear regression

Use regression $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \varepsilon$$
where $X_i$ is a dummy variable defined as 
$$X_i = 
\left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      0 \text{ if transmission is automatic}\\
      1 \text{ if transmission is manual}
    \end{array}
  \right.$$

This is how the data looks on a scatterplot.

```{r}
        ## resize this plot and include a main title and axes labels
        ## include red dots for means of each group?
        ggplot(m, aes(x=am, y=mpg)) + 
                geom_point()
```

Since the regressor (transmission type) has 2 discrete values, the coefficients in this regression model will be interpreted as follows:

$$E(Y_i|X_i = 0) = \beta_0 \text{ where } \beta_0 \text{ is the expected MPG when transmission type is Automatic}$$
$$E(Y_i|X_i = 1) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 $$
Therefore $\beta_1$ is the difference in expected MPG between Automatic and Manual transmission type.

Regression model follows.

```{r lmModel, echo = TRUE}
        model1 <- lm(mpg ~ am, m)
        round(summary(model1)$coef, 4)
```

### Interpretation of coefficients
The expected MPG of cars with an automatic transmission is $17.15$ while that of cars with a manual transmission is $17.15 + 7.24 = 24.38$

### Checking signifiance in difference of group means
We assess the significance in the difference of the group means by using a two-tailed test where $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ and $H_a: \beta_1 > 0$.

Since the $t$ $value = 4.11 > 1.96$,  we reject $H_0$  at a $5\%$ level of significance.  The same conclusion results when using the $p-value = 0.00029 < 0.05$ showing that there is a statistically significant difference in the group means.

### check residuals?


## Two-way ANOVA



```{r}
        model2 <- aov(mpg ~ am, m)
        summary(model2)
```

Since the $p-value = 0.00029 < 0.05$, transmission type is statistically significant and affects MPG.
